# 🧩 Restful Booker API Testing Project  

This repository contains a **complete API testing project** for the **Restful Booker API**, showcasing **Postman** and **Newman** usage for professional-level API testing, dynamic data management, and HTML reporting.  

---

## 📋 Project Overview  

The goal of this project is to validate the **CRUD functionality** of the Restful Booker API and ensure all endpoints work as expected.  
Testing was performed using **Postman collections** and **Newman CLI** to automate execution and generate **HTML reports** for clear documentation.

- `DELETE /booking/:id` → Delete Booking  
- `POST /auth` → Authentication  

### 🔹 Key Testing Areas  

- ✅ Request & Response validation  
- ✅ Status code verification (`200`, `400`, `403`, `404`, `405`)  
- ✅ Dynamic data generation using **environment variables**  
- ✅ Pre-request scripts for random data
