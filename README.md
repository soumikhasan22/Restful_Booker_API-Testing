# 🧩 Restful Booker API Testing Project

This repository contains a complete **API testing project** for the RESTful **Booker API** using **Postman** and **Newman**. The project demonstrates automated API testing, dynamic data management, environment handling, and HTML reporting.

## 📋 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to validate the CRUD functionality of the Restful Booker API and ensure all endpoints work as expected. Testing was performed using Postman collections and automated with Newman CLI to generate HTML reports.

Key skills demonstrated:

- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Partial Update, Delete)
- Environment variable usage for dynamic test data
- Pre-request scripts for random data generation
- Test scripts for response validation, status codes, and business logic
- Automated execution and HTML reporting with Newman
- Handling multiple HTTP response codes (`200`, `400`, `401`, `403`, `404`, `405`, `500`)

## 🧠 Test Scope

### Covered Endpoints

**1. Authentication**
| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/auth` | POST | Generates an authentication token using valid credentials and stores it as `{{token}}`. |

Tests include:

- Valid token creation
- Invalid credentials handling
- Environment variable storage

**2. View All Bookings**
| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/booking` | GET | Retrieves all existing booking IDs. |

Tests include:

- Successful 200 OK response
- Valid data structure
- Graceful handling of 404/405 responses

**3. Create Booking**
| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/booking` | POST | Creates a new booking using dynamic data. |

Pre-request script:

- Randomizes name, total price, and booking dates
- Stores values as environment variables for later verification

Tests include:

- Booking creation success
- Field validation against environment variables
- Handling 400, 404, and unexpected status codes

**4. Get Booking by ID**
| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/booking/{{booking_id}}` | GET | Retrieves booking details for a specific ID. |

Tests include:

- Confirms booking data matches expected values
- Validates response structure and types
- Handles invalid or non-existent IDs

**5. Update Booking (Full Update)**
| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/booking/{{booking_id}}` | PUT | Updates an existing booking fully; requires token. |

Tests include:

- Successful update (200 OK)
- Validation of all updated fields
- Updates environment variables
- Handles 400, 401, 403, 404, 405 errors

**6. Partial Update Booking**
| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/booking/{{booking_id}}` | PATCH | Updates selected fields; requires token. |

Tests include:

- Validates partial updates
- Ensures non-updated fields remain unchanged
- Handles invalid/missing token scenarios

**7. Delete Booking**
| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/booking/{{booking_id}}` | DELETE | Deletes a booking; requires token. |

Tests include:

- Confirms deletion success
- Subsequent GET returns “Not Found”
- Handles invalid/missing token or non-existent ID

**8. Health Check**
| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/ping` | GET | Checks if API is up and responding. |

Tests include:

- Confirms 201 response for successful health check
- Returns descriptive message for invalid endpoints
- Handles unexpected status codes

## 📊 HTML Report

- Generated by running Newman CLI
- Shows test execution results, response times, assertion summary, and error logs

### Key Testing Areas

- Request & Response validation
- Status code verification (`200`, `400`, `403`, `404`, `405`)
- Dynamic data generation using environment variables
- Pre-request scripts for random data
- Test scripts for business logic
- Automated HTML reporting with Newman

## 📂 Folder Structure

| Folder / File | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `Collection/restfulbookercollection.json` | Postman collection with all API requests |
| `Environment/test_booking.postman_environment.json` | Postman environment file with variables |
| `Report/restful-booker-api-testing-2025-11-05-18-45-02-920-0.html` | Newman HTML test execution report |
| `README.md` | Project documentation |
